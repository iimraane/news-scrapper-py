# News Scraper

This project is a Python script designed to scrape articles from Google News and extract the titles of the articles from each redirected site. The script uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to send HTTP requests and parse HTML documents.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Issue:

The script successfully retrieves the latest news but fails to get their titles.
